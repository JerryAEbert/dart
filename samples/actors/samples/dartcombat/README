Dartcombat is a sample game which illustrates how to use isolate communication
and futures.

This version of Dartcombat is the converted version of this game to use the
actor framework. Currently, the converted version only works with Dartium. 

Running:

1. Run Dartium and open the 'dartcombat.html' file.
 

Using dartcombat:

Dartcombat works as follows:
- screen: The screen shows 4 grids. On the left is what player1 knows (his board
  in detail, and his partial knowledge of player2's board), on the right is what
  player2 knows.

- setup: You can place boats on the top boards by clicking and dragging the
  mouse.

- shooting: You can shoot by clicking on the bottom grids. To highlight isolate
  communication and futures, we made each click a supershoot: if a boat is hit,
  the player will automatically scan all cells around the initial shot, and
  progresively hit the boat and sink it.
