# This generates the reference documentation for the core libraries that come
# with dartdoc. It is built on top of dartdoc, which is a general-purpose
# library for generating docs from any Dart code. This library extends that to
# include additional information and styling specific to our corelib.
#
# Usage:
#
# $ ./apidoc
#
# Pretty simple. :)

# TODO(rnystrom): This script is more or less a copy of the one in dartdoc but
# tweaked to output stuff to here instead of inside dartdoc/docs. That's pretty
# gross. Ideally, we'd write the whole thing in Dart an ditch the shell
# but right now we can't even copy binary files using Dart.

# Run from dartdoc directory to get correct relative paths.
