# failed on architectures other than the one you are working on.
#
# 1) Copy the old version of the test to
#    tests/language/src/TestName[Dartc|VM|Frog]Test.dart.
#    to maintain coverage.
# 2) File a bug on each architecture for the failure due to the language change.
# 3) Update the language/src directory with the updated test.

ArithmeticTest: Fail # Issue 1470

# This set of four test components (frog, frogsh, frogium, and webdriver) all
# consume frog output, so if frog is generating the incorrect code, chances are
# it will fail on all of these components.
#
# Further explanation:
# frog: frog compiler, run using the VM
# frogsh: self-hosted frog compiler
# frogium: Dart code compiled with frog VM running under DumpRenderTree
# webdriver: Dart code compiled with frog VM running on an actual browser
# (Chrome, IE, Firefox, Safari, etc). If a test is only failing on a particular
# browser, you can be more specific about the failure by using $browser:
# [ $component == webdriver && $browser == chrome ] for example.
